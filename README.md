# A probably abotive attempt to make an action roguelite version of DCSS using Phaser 3

Really just something to keep busy, and to look through the DCSS code base. It will be nice to just get something running. My hope is that I can rip off all the spells/monster/tiles and build something close to the game, but running around rather than turn based. Monster AI and pathfinding will by neccesity be very basic.
