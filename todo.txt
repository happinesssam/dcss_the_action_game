List of things to do

- Get a level built - just floor tiles with walls. But make it a level state.
- Get it so a basic player sprite is spawned there and can move around
- Scroll around (map is bigger than screen)
- Some data structure tieing player data to the char running around
- Add some mobs, look to pulling in data from DCSS data
- More complex character sprites
- Think about ui
